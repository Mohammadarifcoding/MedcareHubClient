        "post_body": "Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus that can be transmitted to humans from animals such as bats or pigs, or contaminated foods, and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human 1. The virus causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis 1. There is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals, and the primary treatment for humans is supportive care 1. The best way to prevent any outbreak is to cut it off at the start by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the Nipah virus 23. This includes avoiding contact with infected people, washing your hands regularly, especially after visiting with someone who’s sick, and staying informed about the latest developments in the outbreak 23.",

        "post_body": "HIV is a virus that can be transmitted through intimate contact with semen, preseminal fluid, blood, vaginal fluid, rectal fluid, and breast milk 1. Here are some steps you can take to prevent the spread of HIV:\n\n1. Know the risks: Understanding the various modes of transmission and identifying which activities place you at risk is the first step in HIV prevention. HIV is mainly spread through anal sex, vaginal sex, and shared needles 1.\n\n2. Use condoms: Using condoms correctly every time you have sex can help reduce your risk of getting HIV 2.\n\n3. Take PrEP: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prevention strategy in which a daily dose of HIV medications can reduce your risk of getting HIV by as much as 99% 1.\n\n4. Get and stay undetectable: Undetectable = untransmissible (U=U) is an evidence-based strategy in which people with an undetectable viral load cannot pass the virus to others 1.\n\n5. Do not share needles: If you inject drugs, do not share your needles, syringes, or other drug equipment with other people 2.\n\n6. Start treatment for HIV as soon as possible: When you take HIV treatment correctly, it can lower or even stop your chances of spreading the virus to your sexual partners (and help you stay healthy) 3.\n\n7. Stay informed: Keep yourself informed about the latest developments in HIV prevention and treatment 45.\n\nRemember, HIV prevention is about more than just following rules. It’s about knowing the risks and understanding how HIV is transmitted and not transmitted. It’s about taking that extra step to educate yourself about both new and traditional forms of HIV prevention. Most of all, it’s about knowing yourself. In the end, every person is different. Some people are more vulnerable to infection than others. Others may have specific goals, like starting a family or getting pregnant, that require special considerations and carry different risks. To protect yourself, you need to take an honest look at your personal risk factors and design an individual prevention strategy to minimize the risks.",
